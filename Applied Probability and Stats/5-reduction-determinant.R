# Assignment 5 Problem 1 MATH 366

# performs the no divison reduction where it returns a upper triangular matrix
row.reduce.nd = function(A){
  return(reduced_matrix)
}

# function will return the determinant of a matrix to do this we do the no
# division reduction and then count the number of row swaps and then
# depending on if it is an even or odd number of saws we multiply by -1
# If there is an even number of row swaps then it is multipled by 1 otherwise
# it is multipled by 1
# mathematically we do this by (-1)^s where s is the number of row swaps
deter = function(A){
  return(matrix_det)
}
